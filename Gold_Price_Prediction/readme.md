# Gold Price Prediction.

A regression-based Machine Learning project that predicts **Gold ETF (GLD) prices** using major global financial indicators. This project demonstrates strong data understanding, feature analysis, and predictive modeling skills suitable for real-world finance applications.

## Project Summary
The dataset includes features like **SPX**, **USO**, **SLV**, and **EUR/USD**, which influence global gold prices. After performing exploratory analysis and correlation mapping, a **Random Forest Regressor** was trained to predict GLD values.  
The model achieved a **high R² Score**, showing excellent predictive capability.

## Key Highlights
- Built an end-to-end **Regression ML Model**
- Strong **correlation analysis** and feature insights  
- **Random Forest Regressor** used for stable predictions  
- **Actual vs Predicted** visualization for performance validation  
- Built a **custom prediction system** using user inputs  
- Clean, organized notebook and reproducible workflow

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Sample Prediction
**Input**
 - SPX = 1320.0
 - USO = 40.5
 - SLV = 16.2
 - EUR/USD = 1.28


**Output**

Predicted Gold Price (GLD): 158.74
